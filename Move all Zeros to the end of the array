In this article we will learn how to solve the most asked coding interview problem: “Move all Zeros to the end of the array”

Problem Statement: You are given an array of integers, your task is to move all the zeros in the array to the end of the array and move non-negative integers to the front by maintaining their order.

Examples
Example 1:
Input: 1 ,0 ,2 ,3 ,0 ,4 ,0 ,1
Output: 1 ,2 ,3 ,4 ,1 ,0 ,0 ,0
Explanation: All the zeros are moved to the end and non-negative integers are moved to front by maintaining order

Example 2:
Input: 1,2,0,1,0,4,0
Output: 1,2,1,4,0,0,0
Explanation: All the zeros are moved to the end and non-negative integers are moved to front by maintaining order


Solution 1:
Brute Force Approach: 
The extremely naive solution, we can think of, involves the use of an extra array. The algorithm is as follows.

Algorithm:
Suppose, there are N-X zeros and X non-zero elements in the array. We will first copy those X non-zero elements from the original array to a temporary array. 
Then, we will copy the elements from the temporary array one by one and fill the first X places of the original array. 
The last N-X places of the original array will be then filled with zero. Now, our task is completed.
